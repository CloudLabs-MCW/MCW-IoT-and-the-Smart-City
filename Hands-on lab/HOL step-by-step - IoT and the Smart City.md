# IoT and the Smart City hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on-lab, you will build an end-to-end smart city solution. We will begin with deploying the Azure IoT Remote Monitoring Accelerator. This accelerator is meant to serve as an example of the recommendations set forth in the [Azure IoT Reference Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot/). This accelerator may also serve as a customizable foundation for any real-world Remote Monitoring IoT systems. It has been built with the flexibility to define telemetry schemas, device types, groups, rules, and more. The Remote Monitoring accelerator also supports both simulated and real IoT devices - including an IoT Edge devices. The Remote Monitoring Web application displays all IoT data with charts and alerts based on pre-configured rules for each type of IoT device. You will also use this custom web app to configure IoT devices and send control messages to them via the IoT Hub.

In this lab, we will deploy an Edge Device with a custom built module along with an on-device analytics engine which intelligently filters vehicle telemetry data for anomalies and transmits only this subset of data to IoT Hub thus reducing noise and saving on bandwidth and its associated costs. Non-critical data will be sent to storage on the device and uploaded to the cloud once connectivity is established. All telemetry data will also be stored in Time Series Insights in the cloud and ordered based on the timestamp in the telemetry message. All critical data will also flow through an Azure Function that routes critical alerts to a Service Bus Queue for separate processing and storage.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build an end-to-end IoT solution that processes and analyzes data both in the field and in the cloud.

## Overview

The IoT and the Smart City hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on IoT Hub, IoT Edge devices, Cosmos DB, Time Series Insights, Service Bus, and related Azure services. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

![The Solution Architecture diagram is described in the text following the diagram.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image2.png 'Solution Architecture diagram')

The solution begins with an **IoT Edge Device** that would be installed on each city bus, which is responsible for reading the vehicle telemetry from the bus, such as speed, fuel level, oil level, engine temperature, etc., generated by **custom C\# module**. A **Stream Analytics module** is loaded on the IoT Edge device to filter the vehicle telemetry data so that only anomalies are sent to **IoT Hub**, all data is also stored locally on the device in the **Edge Storage Module**. The Edge Storage module is configured to upload data to Azure Blob Storage when adequate connectivity is achieved. A GPS IoT device is separately added to the bus to periodically send location and speed data to IoT Hub.

An IoT device is added to various traffic lights to send timing and voltage telemetry. It is registered as a device in IoT Hub, including properties such as its longitude and latitude and serial number. It can receive cloud-to-device messages through IoT Hub, allowing upstream services to send updates like adjusting the timing of its lights. The bus and traffic light devices are simulated using the IoT Remote Monitoring solution device simulator.

The Azure IoT Hub is configured with multiple consumer groups. This allows multiple downstream services to simultaneously read the incoming data.  **Time Series Insights** instance and an Azure Function microservice will read the incoming data. Time Series Insights is used to store the raw time series data and provides advanced filtering, custom ad-hoc queries, and visualizations that can overlay data from several classes of IoT devices. A second input into Time Series Insights provides the path for non-critical vehicle telemetry to be included from BLOB Storage.

An **Azure Function** using a separate consumer group routes filtered bus engine-related critical messages to a **Service Bus Queue**, where another **Azure Function** is triggered and outputs the critical alerts to a new collection in Cosmos DB.

The web app, which is part of the IoT Remote Monitoring solution, uses Device Twin information to display IoT devices on a map, provide real-time charts, and allows you to manage alert rules and device control messages. It is also used to provision new IoT devices and send manual cloud-to-device messages through IoT Hub.

## Exercise 1: Set up the IoT Remote Monitoring solution environment

**Duration:** 30 Minutes

In this exercise, you will take advantage of the 'Remote Monitoring' Microsoft Azure IoT Solution Accelerator. This accelerator will provision the components required to implement the IoT Remote Monitoring solution. This includes an Azure Resource Group, IoT Hub, Azure Storage account, App Service for hosting the monitoring web application, Device Provisioning Services, Virtual Machine, and related components that host the Function Application microservices responsible for creating, capturing, and processing IoT device messages, and a Cosmos DB instance for storing reference, alert, and telemetry data.

4. After stopping the simulation, take a moment to browse through the site. You will notice an interactive map as the centerpiece, provided by the Azure Maps service that was provisioned as part of the solution. This will display each of your IoT devices that have location information.

    a. To the left of the map is a count of the devices, as well as the number of alarms and warnings that have been triggered based on pre-configured rules. We will add custom rules later on.

    b. Directly to the right of the map is a list of system alarms for the displayed devices.

    c. Beneath the map is a flowing line chart that displays telemetry data for selected devices and data points.

    d. To the right of the chart is a list of system KPIs (key performance indicators) that shows the number of alarms by device type and whether that number is increasing or decreasing.

   ![The Remote Monitoring Dashboard is displayed, the key performance indicators chart in the lower-right corner.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image183.png 'Remote Monitoring Dashboard')

## Exercise 2: Provision additional Azure services

**Duration:** 45 minutes

Use the Azure portal to create services that will be used by the overall IoT solution environment. You will create an additional consumer group on the default messages/events IoT Hub endpoint. This will allow us to add more readers that can read the massive amounts of incoming IoT data being ingested by IoT Hub. This will help prevent conflicts from multiple readers attempting to modify the checkpoints and offsets of the partitions holding the messages. Next, you will review the already provisioned Azure Time Series Insights instance to collect, filter, and display all-time series data flowing in from your simulated IoT devices as well as your IoT Edge device. In this exercise, you will provision a service bus queue to house engine alerts, a container registry to hold the custom Vehicle Telemetry module, and additional storage account containers that are required later in the lab.

### Task 3: Review the consumer groups in the IoT Hub

In this task, you will review the consumer groups that were added to the default messages/events IoT Hub endpoint, for other Azure resources to use. A consumer group can have a single reader and keeps track of items that have already been read, and what still remains to be read. Define a consumer group for each subscriber of IoT Hub event data.

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the **Azure Management** portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Browse to the **Resource Group** that was automatically created in the previous exercise. You can find your resource groups by selecting Resource groups in the left-hand side menu on the portal.

3. Locate your **IoT Hub** within the resource group. Its name will start with "iothub-", followed by randomly generated characters.

    ![In Resource group list, the IoT Hub is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image24.png 'Resource group listing')

4. In the left-hand menu, select the **Built-in endpoints** item, this will bring up the **Events** endpoint information and consumer groups.

    ![The built-in endpoints menu item is selected, beneath the Events section, consumer groups are listed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image221.png 'IoT Consumer Groups')

5. Create a new consumer group by typing **queuefuncconsumergroup** into a Consumer Groups text box, we will use this consumer group later on in this lab.

![The list of consumer groups is displayed, in the textbox at the end of the list, queuefuncconsumergroup is typed in.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image222.png 'IoT Hub Create Consumer Group')

   Next, we will obtain a connection string for this IoT Hub for use later on in this lab. Select **Shared access policies**, then select **iothubowner**, and copy the primary key connection string.

   ![In the IoT Hub menu, Shared Access policies is selected. In the list of policies, iothubowner is selected, in the policy blade the copy button next to the Connection string - primary key text box is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image240.png)

### Task 4: Review the Azure Time Series Insights instance

Azure Time Series Insights is the first fully managed time series database on the Azure platform. It was developed primarily with high volume IoT data in mind, where having a single location in which you can quickly view this information and derive insights on it is typically no small feat. Although the IoT Remote Monitoring solution you provisioned stores its simulated device data in Cosmos DB, you will be able to ingest that same data into Time Series Insights, along with data generated by your IoT Edge device. This is because all data flows through IoT Hub as the initial point of ingress. You have a time series consumer group on the Events endpoint specifically for Time Series Insights to be able to simultaneously read and store the same data that will land in Cosmos DB, as well as the added IoT Edge data. After reviewing the Time Series Insights instance, you will see how it's configured to use the IoT Hub consumer group as an input.

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the **Azure Management** portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Select the resource group that you created when deploying the Remote Monitoring Accelerator. In the list of resources, select the item with the type **Time Series Insights environment**.

    ![In the list of resources, the Time Series Insights environment is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image184.png 'Time Series Insights environment')

3. Select **Event Sources** from the left-hand menu.

4. View the IoT Hub Event Source.

    ![Event Sources is selected under Environment Toplogy, and the Add button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image185.png 'Event Sources blade')

### Task 5: Provision an Azure Container Registry

IoT Edge devices use one or more modules to perform a series of actions locally on the device before sending data up to the cloud. Modules include custom modules written in a language like C\#, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, Azure Functions, Azure Storage, and SQL Azure. Each of these modules is hosted within a Docker container. We will be adding three modules for the IoT Edge device: a custom C\# module, an Azure Stream Analytics module, and the Storage Module. Modules are defined with all required files in a container image. The images are then pushed to a registry that stores and manages them. The final step is to deploy the images from the registry onto your IoT Edge devices. Two popular Docker registry services available in the cloud are Azure Container Registry and Docker Hub. We will be using Azure Container Registry to manage and deploy the IoT Edge modules.

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the **Azure Management** portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Select **+ Create a resource**, then type **container registry** into the search box on top. Select **Container Registry** from the results.

    ![The search field in the New blade displays Azure Container Registry.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image36.png 'New blade')

3. Select the **Create** button on the **Container Registry overview** blade.

4. On the **Create container registry** form, specify the following configuration options:

    a. Select the **Subscription** you used when deploying the accelerator.

    b. Select your **Resource Group**, ensuring it's the same one in which your new components have been created.

    c. **Registry Name**: Unique value for the registry name (ensure the green check mark appears).

    d. Select the same **Location** as your Resource Group and other services.

    e. Select the **Basic** SKU.

    ![The Create container registry blade displays with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image37.png 'Create container registry blade')

5. Select **Create**.

6. After provisioning is complete, go to your new Container Registry resource and select **Access keys** from the left-hand menu.

7. Enable the **Admin user**.

8. Copy the **Login server**, **Username**, and **Password** values and save them for later.

    ![In the Container registry blade, under Settings, Access keys is selected. The copy buttons for Login server, Username, and password are all called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image38.png 'Container registry blade')

### Task 6: Obtain the Storage Account Connection String

1. Return to the Resource Group that houses the resources for the IoT Remote Monitoring solution. From the list, select the Storage account resource whose name shares the same last 5 characters as the IoT Hub name.

   ![In the list of resources, the storage account that shares the same suffix as the IoT Hub is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image241.png 'Select the Storage Account Resource')

2. From the left-hand menu, select **Access keys**, then copy the value of the Connection string of **key1**. We will be using this value later on in the lab.

3. Also save the name of the storage account, as we'll be needing this value later on in this lab as well.

### Task 7: Create storage account containers required for the lab

While we are in the storage account, we will need to create two blob containers for use in this lab.

1. The first container we will create is responsible for housing the definition and configuration of the Azure Stream Analytics job that we will have running on an Edge device later in this lab.

   a. From the menu to the left, scroll down to the **Blob service** section and select **Containers**.

   b. Select **+ Container** at the top of the Containers blade, then provide the following:

      - **Name**: asa-container

      - **Public access level**: Container

    ![The blobs menu item is selected in th left menu, the + Container button is displayed and a form with the previously defined fields are displayed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image95.png 'Create blob storage container')

2. The second container will be responsible for holding the 'cold' telemetry data coming in from an Edge device. This data is a history of all telemetry gathered from an Edge device that is not uploaded to the cloud in real time.

   a. From the menu to the left, scroll down to the **Blob service** section and select **Containers**.

   b. Select **+ Container** at the top of the Containers blade, then provide the following:

      - **Name**: telemetrysink

      - **Public access level**: Container

### Task 8: Retrieve Secrets from the Key Vault

Later in this lab, we will be making use of the Azure Key Vault. This vault is created so that secrets do not need to reside in code. A Key Vault resource was generated when we created the IoT Remote Monitoring accelerator.

1. Return to the resource group that was created for this lab. In the list of resources select the Azure Key Vault resource. Record the name of the Key Vault for use later on in this lab.

    ![In the list of resources, the key vault resource is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image243.png 'Key Vault Resource')

    ![The secrets menu item is selected and the secret with the name aaAppId is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image244.png 'The aadAppId secret key')

3. Select the Current Version for this key.

   ![A version list is displayed showing a single guid value, this guid value is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image245.png 'Select the current key version')

4. At the bottom of the next screen, copy and store the secret value. We will be using this value later on in the lab.

    ![A textbox is displayed beneath the Show Secret Value button, a copy button to the right of this textbox is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image246.png 'Copy the secret value for aadAppId')

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the following key: **aadAppSecret**.

## Exercise 3: Create bus and traffic light simulated devices, and add alerts and filters

**Duration:** 60 minutes

The IoT Remote Monitoring solution allows you to provision and collect telemetry from both simulated and real devices. As part of the process, telemetry schema information is applied to the devices twin through its reported properties. The properties are read as the microservice that's executing the EventProcessor processes incoming messages from IoT Hub. The EventProcessor is an Azure Function that was deployed as part of the Remote Monitoring Accelerator. The telemetry metadata is written to Cosmos DB, and used by the Remote Monitoring web UI to extract and display the data in the charts and maps. The metadata is also used to define cloud-to-device messages and actions that can be performed on the device. The web UI uses this information to send control messages to the devices. This metadata is added to simulated and non-simulated devices alike.

In this exercise, you will define metadata for new device types that will be provisioned, and whose telemetry will be simulated by the solution. Each new device type will have a state script to generate telemetry that changes the device's state, such as speed, location, voltage, or other data that relates to the device. In addition, you will define cloud-to-device messages and actions for the new device types. Then, you will create and run a new simulation locally, using a Visual Studio solution. Finally, you will create new alerts and filters through the Remote Monitoring web app interface.

We have created the following files for you, located within the device-simulation project (Lab-files/DeviceSimulation/Services/data/devicemodels):

- Device models:

  - bus-01.json

  - bus-02.json

  - trafficlight-01.json

  - trafficlight-02.json

- Scripts (/scripts subfolder):

  - bus-01-state.js

  - bus-02-state.js

  - trafficlight-01-state.js

  - trafficlight-02-state.js

  - DecreaseTiming-method.js

  - IncreaseTiming-method.js

You will need to finish configuring these files for the simulator.

When we create an alert, this will most likely be the light that triggers it.

24. Open DecreaseTiming-method.js and see how it is used as an action method to reset the timing state of a traffic light by decreasing the timing 15 seconds at a time. This is executed by a cloud-to-device call from the monitoring web app.

### Task 3: Explore the remaining files to understand what is happening

Below is a table containing file paths and an explanation of what each does in the simulator. There are a few key things to point out so that you know how the Service SDK for Azure IoT Devices can be used to programmatically manage devices.

1. With the device-simulation solution still open in Visual Studio, look at each of the following files and descriptions to understand how things work:

    - Visual Studio Project: Services
      - **File Path**: Devices.cs
      - **Description**: GetAsync method (line 102) accepts a Device Id and uses it to retrieve the device details from IoT Hub, using the Service SDK's RegistryManager. It will optionally retrieve the device twin which can be used to view the current twin properties and update their values. CreateAsync method (line 156) is used to provision a new IoT Device, using the RegistryManager. It also creates a new device twin containing the IsSimulated tag. This is how the IoT Monitor app can differentiate between simulated and physical devices.

    - Visual Studio Project: Services
        - **File Path**: DeviceClient.cs
        - **Description**: SendMessageAsync method (line 100) constructs a new Message object that it will send to IoT Hub. It includes the event message properties to include the message content type (JSON), and the schema name, as defined in the device model scripts you edited earlier. The microservice running the IoT Hub EventProcessor will look for these values before processing messages and saving them to Cosmos DB.

    - Visual Studio Project: SimulationAgent
        - **File Path**: SimulationManager.cs
        - **Description**: Each device is assigned an instance of a DeviceStateActor (DeviceState\\DeviceStateActor.cs), DeviceConnectionActor (DeviceConnection\\DeviceConnectionActor.cs), DeviceTelemetryActor (DeviceTelemetry\\DeviceTelemetryActor.cs), DevicePropertiesActor(DeviceProperties\\DevicePropertiesActor.cs), and DeviceReplayActor(DeviceReplay\\DeviceReplayActor.cs). This class manages all of the actors for this solution - generated through the *TryToCreateActorsForPartitionAsync* and *CreateActorsForDeviceAsync*. Through the actors, the simulated device will:
            - Connect to IoT Hub.
            - Bootstrap the device to retrieve it, create if necessary, and update the device twin state.
            - Update the device state using the state scripts we created, in order to send telemetry.
            - Sends telemetry using the message template provided, as seen in the bus and traffic light device model scripts you edited earlier. Uses the DeviceClient class to send the message through the Device SDK for Azure IoT Devices.

    - Visual Studio Project: WebService
        - **File Path**: v1\\Controllers\\SimulationsController
        - **Description**: This web API controller contains REST methods that allow you to retrieve, insert, update, and delete device simulations. The simulation values are updated in Cosmos DB by way of the Simulations service (Services project -- Simulations.cs), which uses the running pcs-storage-adapter service to modify the values in Cosmos DB. We will be using this next.

### Task 4: Configure and run the Storage Adapter project

The Storage Adapter project (pcs-storage-adapter) is another microservice that constantly runs and provides REST-based endpoints to manage simple key/value data in Cosmos DB. It is used by several services, including the web service within the device-simulator project, as seen in the previous task. This needs to be configured, then executed to run before creating and running simulations on the new devices locally.

1. Browse to the storage-adapter solution in the following location: LabFiles\\StorageAdapter.

8. Leave this project running in the background.

### Task 6: Create alerts and filters in the monitoring web app

The IoT Remote Monitoring web interface enables you to create filters that help group devices by type or other parameters. You can also create alerts that are fired when certain criteria are met, enabling you to see the alerts alongside your device data or on the map. In this task, you will create filters for your buses and traffic lights, then create an alert for traffic lights whose voltage exceed a predefined level.

1. Navigate back to the monitoring web app. If you don't remember the path or have closed the previous browser session, the naming convention is **https://[your solution name].azurewebsites.net/dashboard**. You may need to refresh the browser window if it has been running for some time and is unresponsive.

2. One of the first things you may notice is that there are new telemetry data points listed above the graph. You should also see new devices showing up on the map. In the screenshot below, the new fuel level telemetry option is selected, and data for the two new buses appear beneath. (Note: You may need to wait a few minutes with the simulator running in order for the New York data points to appear - zoom out the map to see them.)

    ![A map displaying the location of devices with a map marker.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image67.png 'Device Maps')

    ![A chart displaying the fuel level consumption of simulated bus devices.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image191.png 'Fuel level telemetry chart')

3. Create a new device group by selecting **Manage device groups** on the upper-right portion of the dashboard.

    ![The manage device groups button is selected from the top menu of the dashboard.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image68.png 'Manage device groups')

    e. **Type**: Text

    ![In the manage device groups settings fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image69.png 'Create device group section')

5. Select **Save**.

6. Create another device group with the following parameters in the form:

    a. **Name**: Traffic Lights

    b. **Field**: Properties.Reported.Type

    c. **Operato**r: = Equals

    d. **Value**: Traffic Light

    e. **Type**: Text

7. After creating both device groups, you may select them using the filter drop-down list on the top of the **Dashboard** screen. In the screenshot below, we have selected Buses. Notice that the shows only the two Bus devices.

    ![The Monitoring Web App dashboard displays with filtered by the selected group of devices.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image70.png 'Monitoring Web App dashboard filtered by device group')

8. Select **Rules** in the left-hand menu.

9. Change the filter to show All devices so you can view the list of existing rules.

    a. **Rule Name**: Voltage Too High

    b. **Description**: Traffic light voltage is higher than normal.

    c. **Device group**: Select your Traffic Lights group.

    d. **Calculation**: Select Instant.

    e. **Condition1**:

    - **Field**: voltage

    - **Operator**: \>=

    - **Value**: 74

    f. **Severity level**: Critical

    g. **Rule status**: Enabled

    ![The New rule form is displays and field values are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image72.png 'New rule form')

    ![A continuation of the new rule form with fields set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image192.png 'New rule section')

11. Select **Apply**. Notice that it shows 2 devices are affected by this rule.

12. Navigate back to the dashboard. It may take a few minutes for the alerts to start appearing. When you filter by Traffic Lights and zoom in on the map over New York, you will see both traffic lights pinned to the map. One with the critical alert. Also notice the alarm count on the left.

    ![The remote monitoring solution dashboard is set to filter on the Traffic Lights device group. The Alarm count is 1, and a voltage alert is called out in the Alerts list.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image73.png 'Monitoring Web App dashboard ')

13. Select the **traffic light** with the error indicator on the map. The device details will be displayed to the right, along with a list of the triggered alarms.

14. Select **Maintenance** on the left-hand menu.

15. Select the **Voltage Too High** alert. You will see a list of occurrences and devices that triggered the alarm. Using the menu on top, you can close or acknowledge alerts for each selected occurrence in the list.

### Task 7: Send jobs to IoT devices

In this task, you will send a job to one of the traffic light devices, using the DecreaseTiming job defined in the scripts folder of the device-simulation project.

1. Navigate back to the monitoring web app's dashboard.

2. Select the **timing** telemetry option. Observe the current timing for the traffic lights. One should consistently be 90 (seconds), and the other 65.

    ![In the Telemetry section, timing (2) is selected and a chart is displayed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image75.png 'Telemetry section')

3. Navigate to **Device Explorer** using the left-hand menu.

4. Check the box next to **GUIDVALUE.Trafficlight-01.1** (or whichever the traffic light \#1 is named in your list - the names could be long, so selecting one will open an overview blade displaying the full name of the device).

5. Select **Jobs** in the top menu.

6. Select **Methods** for the job type.

7. In the **Method Name**, select **DecreaseTiming**.

8. Provide any name for your Job.

9. Select **Apply**. You may view the job status in the maintenance page, if desired.

    ![The Device Explorer menu item is selected. The Device list is displayed with a checkbox checked next to the first device in the list.

The Apply button on the form is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image76.png 'Devices section')

10. Navigate back to the dashboard and view the **timing** telemetry once again. This time, you should notice that the traffic light timing for traffic light \#1 decreased from 90 seconds to 75. (You may need to wait a couple of minutes to see the effect in the chart)

    ![In the Telemetry section, the decrease of the timing of a traffic light is highlighted on the graph.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image77.png 'Telemetry section')

## Exercise 4: Create IoT Edge device and custom modules

**Duration:** 60 minutes

Azure IoT Edge devices can run on in locations where there is little to no internet connectivity, yet they allow you to run powerful modules locally, enabling you to apply your business logic in place. This is especially powerful when coupled with sensors that generate a lot of data, and you only want to send the most important data to the cloud.

In this scenario, IoT Edge devices will be installed on city buses. You will create a Stream Analytics module to filter the vehicle telemetry data from simulated sensors located within a custom module that you will also build and deploy. When the Stream Analytics module finds behavior consistent with aggressive driving or impending engine failure, the data will be sent to Azure via IoT Hub. The obvious benefit to this is that the massive amount of data can be analyzed locally, and only the important data is sent over the expensive cellular data connection. All data is also stored on the Edge Device itself and is uploaded automatically via Blob Storage channels in the cloud once sufficient connectivity is established.

    ```

### Task 3: Create and upload the custom C\# IoT Edge module for vehicle telemetry

In this task, you will use Visual Studio Code to complete the custom C\# IoT Edge module that simulates vehicle telemetry representing bus sensor data. Then you will create the Docker container, and register it in your Container Registry instance so it can be deployed to the IoT Edge device.

This simulator accomplishes many things. As part of the project, Fabrikam city wanted to apply machine learning to determine if a bus driver is driving dangerously. A machine learning model has been supplied in this project and is used to determine the safety of the driver by evaluating the current bus speed, with the location (latitude and longitude) of the bus. The prediction from this model is populated in the telemetry data so that it can be used for future processing.

Additionally, all telemetry obtained from the bus sensors is saved in local blob storage. The storage module is responsible for automatically uploading this data to the cloud when a feasible internet connection is established.

1. Open Visual Studio Code and install [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) and [Azure IoT Edge extension](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for Visual Studio Code. 


2. Select **File Open Folder**...

    ![File/Open Folder is selected in the Visual Studio Code window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image86.png 'Visual Studio Code window')

3. Browse to the lab-files in the Hands-on lab folder. Select the **VehicleTelemetrySimulator** folder.

4. You may see one or more errors about unresolved dependencies or needing to add build and debug assets. Dismiss these messages, as they are not pertinent to the IoT Edge module project.

    ![In the Visual Studio Code window, pop up messages are displayed, the Don't ask again and Close buttons are called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image87.png 'Visual Studio Code window')

5. Open **Program.cs** under the **modules** folder.

    ![In the Explorer window, the modules folder is open and Program.cs is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/imageModuleProgramcs.png 'Explorer window')

6. Complete the code for TODO items 1-18.

    a. The first item to complete is to add the device connection string.

    ```C#
     //TODO: 1 - set device connection string for the device client
    //static string _deviceConnectionString = "<device connection string goes here>";
    ```

    b. Set the connection string to the local IoT Edge Blob storage.

    ```C#
    //TODO: 2 - set the connection string for local blob storage
    //static string _storageConnectionString = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;BlobEndpoint=http://azureblobstorageoniotedge:11002/edgestorage;AccountName=edgestorage;AccountKey=pM8cWFj0L8h+VKRfE8Fy3tVVtdfOR4bCIzX8N/sDiK1X0znhu8iatFwVfjzwjedDKe5ln+2cI7wpy+2eO1vvQQ==";
    ```

    c. Create the module client by un-commenting the following line of code. The Module Client is initialized using the device connection string that we initialized our Edge VM with.

    ```C#
    // TODO: 3 - Create module client from container environment variable
    // _vehicleTelemetryModuleClient = await ModuleClient.CreateFromEnvironmentAsync(TransportType.Mqtt);
    ```

   d. Create the device client by un-commenting the following two lines of code. The device client is responsible for retrieving the desired properties from the device twin in the cloud, as well as sending reported properties to the device twin. The values that will be reported are the Latitude, Longitude, and Borough values. The second line of code hooks up a call back method that is called on the device once a desired property has been changed in the Device Twin in the cloud.

   ```C#
    // TODO: 4 - Create device client to obtain desired properties from Twin and update reported properties
    // _deviceClient = DeviceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(_deviceConnectionString);
    // await _deviceClient.SetDesiredPropertyUpdateCallbackAsync(onDesiredPropertiesUpdateAsync, null);
   ```

   e. Use the device client to retrieve the desired properties from the Device Twin in the cloud. Use these values to populate the initial state of the current device.

   ```C#
   // TODO: 5 - initialize device instance with values obtained from the device twin desired properties
    // var twin = await _deviceClient.GetTwinAsync();
    // var desired = twin.Properties.Desired;
    // await UpdateDeviceInstanceFromDesiredProperties(desired);
   ```

    f. Initialize local edge blob storage.

    ```C#
    // TODO: 6 - initialize iot edge storage
        // _storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(_storageConnectionString);
        // _blobClient = _storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();
        // _blobContainer = _blobClient.GetContainerReference("telemetry");
        // if(!_blobContainer.Exists()){
        //     _blobContainer.CreateIfNotExists();
        // }
    ```

    g. Populate the current 'state' field values from the retrieved Desired Properties obtain from the Device Twin.

    ```C#
    if (desired["VIN"] != null)
    {
        // TODO: 7 - Set the vin to the value in the device twin
        // _vin = desired["VIN"];
    }
    if (desired["Borough"] != null)
    {
        // TODO: 8 - Set the borough to the value in the device twin
        // _borough = desired["Borough"];
    }

    if (desired["Latitude"] != null)
    {
        // TODO: 9 - Set the latitude to the value in the device twin
        // _latitude = Convert.ToSingle(desired["Latitude"]);
    }
    if (desired["Longitude"] != null)
    {
        // TODO: 10 - Set the longitude to the value in the device twin
        // _longitude = Convert.ToSingle(desired["Longitude"]);
    }
    ```

    h. Initialize a timer to send reported properties to the Device Twin at regular intervals.

    ```C#
        // TODO: 11 - update reported properties at a specified time interval
        // _timer = new Timer(UpdateReportedProperties, null, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(_secondsToTwinReportedPropertiesUpdate), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(_secondsToTwinReportedPropertiesUpdate));
    ```

    i. Implement the code that sends the current state of the device to the cloud through reported properties of the device twin.

    ```C#
        // TODO: 12 - update reported properties with the IoT Hub with most recent Lat/Long
        //patch the changed properties (Latitude, Longitude, Borough)
        // TwinCollection patch = new TwinCollection();
        // patch["Latitude"] = _latitude;
        // patch["Longitude"] = _longitude;
        // patch["Borough"] = _borough;
        // patch["Telemetry"] = _telemetryDefn;
        // Task.Run(async () => await _deviceClient.UpdateReportedPropertiesAsync(patch));
    ```

    j. Initialize the machine learning context, load its model, and create an instance of the prediction engine to evaluate the incoming telemetry for dangerous driving.

    ```C#
        // TODO: 13 - Initialize machine learning prediction model infrastructure
        // var mlContext = new MLContext();
        // ITransformer mlModel = mlContext.Model.Load("BusMlModel/MLModel.zip", out var modelInputSchema);
        // var predEngine = mlContext.Model.CreatePredictionEngine<ModelInput, ModelOutput>(mlModel);
    ```

    k. Populate the input model with the current state data of the bus. This information will be used by the prediction engine to determine if the bus driver is driving dangerously.

    ```C#
        // TODO 14: Create input for the machine learning prediction engine by setting the
        //         device current latitude, longitude, and speed limit
        // var mlInput = new ModelInput()
        // {
        //    Latitude = currRouteData.Latitude,
        //    Longitude = currRouteData.Longitude,
        //    BusSpeed = currRouteData.BusSpeed
        // };
    ```

    l. Use the prediction engine to determine if the driver is driving dangerously.

    ```C#
        // TODO 15: Use this input model to have the prediction engine determine if the
        //          current speed for the device is safe for the latitude and longitude location
        // var mlOutput = predEngine.Predict(mlInput);
    ```

    m. Populate the predicted value into the telemetry being sent by the module.

    ```C#
        // TODO: 16 Populate the machine learning prediction into the telemetry data for upstream systems
        // mlDetectedAggressiveDriving = mlOutput.Prediction
    ```

    n. Output the generated telemetry from the module asynchronously.

    ```C#
        // TODO: 17 - Have the ModuleClient send the event message asynchronously, using the specified output name
        // await _vehicleTelemetryModuleClient.SendEventAsync(outputName, message);
    ```

    o. Save all data to local blob storage

    ```C#
        // TODO: 18 - Send all telemetry to local blob storage
        // var blockBlob = _blobContainer.GetBlockBlobReference($"telemetry_{info.timestamp.Ticks}.json");
        // blockBlob.UploadText(serializedString);
    ```

7. Save your changes.

8. In VS Code, open **module.json**, in the repository property, change the URI to **LOGIN SERVER/vehicletelemetrysimulator**, replacing the login server value with your container registry login server value. The login server takes the form of **[container repository name].azurecr.io**.

    ![In the JSON editor the image repository property is highlighted showing the repository for the compiled image.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image199.png 'Image Repository property')

9. Sign in to Docker by entering the following command in the VS Code integrated terminal, using the Container Registry credentials and server information:

    ```Bash
    docker login -u <username>    -p <password>    <Login server>
    ```

10. To build the project, right-click the **module.json** file in the Explorer and select **Build IoT Edge Module Image**.

    ![The module.json file is right-clicked and the Build IoT Edge Module Image item is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image267.png 'Build IoT Edge module')

26. **Save** the query.

### Task 5: Deploy custom modules to IoT Edge device

In this task, you will deploy the vehicle telemetry module, Stream Analytics module, and an IoT Edge Storage module to the IoT Edge device. All will be deployed simultaneously so you can register the module routes to send vehicle telemetry data to the Stream Analytics module, then send the filtered data upstream to IoT Hub as needed. The Vehicle Telemetry module will also send all telemetry data into IoT Edge Storage. The IoT Edge Storage module is responsible for synchronizing this data to a storage account in the cloud. The IoT Edge Storage module is intelligent, it can be configured to delete local blocks of data that have already been moved to the cloud, as well as recover from connection interruptions. IoT Edge Storage is ideal for a sometimes connected scenario, data will be held locally until a feasible internet connection is available to upload to the cloud.

                        "target": "telemetrysink"
                    }
                }
            },
            "deleteAfterUpload": true
        }
        ```

        ![The Update IoT Edge Module blade is shown with the Module Twin Settings tab selected with a textbox populated with the JSON based configuration above.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image274.png)

21. Press **Update**.

22. Select **Next: Routes >** underneath the IoT Edge modules list.

23. In the **Routes** table add the following. Replace _{moduleName}_ with the Stream Analytics module name that you copied):

    | Name | Value |
    |------|---------|
    | alertsToCloud | FROM /messages/modules/{moduleName}/outputs/* INTO $upstream |
    | telemetryToAsa | FROM /messages/modules/VehicleTelemetry/outputs/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint("/modules/{moduleName}/inputs/VehicleTelemetry") |

    ![The routes are displayed for the bus1 modules as specified in the previous table above.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image114.png 'Set Modules, Routes page')

24. Select **Review + Create**.

25. In the Review screen, select **Create**.

26. After approximately 4 minutes, return to the device details page. You should see the three new modules running, along with the IoT Edge agent module and the IoT Edge hub.

    ![On the Deployed Modules tab, under Name, iot-edge-sa, azureblobstorageoniotedge, and VehicleTelemetry modules are called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image115.png 'Device Details page Deployed Modules tab')

27. Go back to your Bash shell that is connected to the Linux VM containing your IoT Edge device.

28. Execute the following to make sure all the modules are running in Docker:

    ```Bash
    sudo iotedge list
    ```

    ![Bash window displays the list of docker images running in the IoT Edge simulator VM.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image116.png 'Bash shell')

29. You should have five containers running at this point.

30. View the Stream Analytics module logs to see the telemetry it is reading, as well as any outputs it generates based on anomalies. You should see a large degree more vehicle telemetry feeding into the Stream Analytics module than what it sends out. This, of course, is by design. Replace {moduleName} with the Stream Analytics module name. Press <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to return to the command line.

    ```Bash
    sudo iotedge logs -f {moduleName}
    ```

    ![In the Output window, results from the Stream Analytics module logs display.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image206.png 'Output window')

31. View the generated data by viewing the log for the VehicleTelemetry module as follows. Press <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to return to the command line.

    ```Bash
    sudo iotedge logs -f VehicleTelemetry
    ```

32. Notice the log output as shown below. There are many "Sending message: \[VehicleTelemetry\]" events, and one output generated (highlighted). The output name is **alert**, matching one of the two outputs we created in the Stream Analytics module. The message content is sent to IoT Hub, including the additional fields added by the Stream Analytics query. In this case, the telemetry data is flagged as aggressive driving (aggressivedriving: 1).

    ![In the Bash window, results from the Vehicle Telemetry module logs display.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image207.png 'Bash window')

33. Leave the IoT Edge device running for the remainder of the lab.

## Exercise 5: Create an Azure Function to add critical engine alerts to the Service Bus Queue

As you remember, you created an Azure Service Bus Queue to hold messages flagged as critical engine alerts. This queue is to be fed messages from the IoT Hub that match a certain criteria. In this exercise, you will create the Azure Function that reads messages from the IoT Hub, identifies messages fitting the criteria and moves this information to the alert-q created earlier in this lab.

### Task 1: Create a new Function App

A Function app is a logical collection of functions on the Azure platform. Each Function app may have multiple functions contained within. Create a new Function App

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the Azure Management portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Select **Create a new resource**, then type **function app** into the search box on top. Select **Function App** from the results.

    ![The Search field in the New blade is set to Function App.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image127.png 'Azure Portal New blade')

3. Select the **Create** button on the Function App overview blade.

4. On the Create Function App screen, in the **Basics** tab, specify the following configuration options:

    a. **Subscription**: select a valid subscription.

    b. Specify your **Resource Group**, ensuring it's the same one in which your new components have been created.

    c. **Name**: Unique value for the app name (ensure the green check mark appears).

    d. **Runtime Stack**: select **Node.js**.

    e. **Version**: select **12**.

    f. **Publish**: select **Code**.

    g. **Region**: select the region nearest you.

    ![The Create Function app form is displayed with fields populated with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image128.png 'Create Function App blade')

5. Press **Review and create**, then **Create** once the summary screen is displayed.

### Task 2: Add new Function to process messages received by the IoT Hub

1. Open the Function App provisioned in the last task.

2. Underneath the Function App, select the **Functions** item, and press the **+ Add** button.

   ![The function app is expanded and the functions item is selected. The + Add button is selected in the functions window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image216.png 'Create new Function')

3. On the **New Function** blade, in the Templates search box, type IoT Hub, then select **IoT Hub (Event Hub)**.

   ![The Templates search box is displayed with IoT Hub typed in and the IoT Hub(Event Hub) template is selected from the list.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image217.png 'IoT Hub Template')

4. On the **New Function** blade **Details** tab, name the function **IoTHub_CriticalAlerts**, and enter **queuefuncconsumergroup** in the **Event Hub consumer group** textbox.

   ![The New Function blade is shown populated with the previous values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image218.png)

5. Beneath the **Event Hub connection** field, press **New** and select **IoT Hub**, then select the IoT Hub being used for this lab. Ensure the **Endpoint** is set to **Events (built-in endpoint)**.

   ![The New Event Hub connection form is displayed with IoT Hub selected. The IoT Hub drop down is set to the IoT Hub from the remote monitoring solution, and the Endpoint is set to Events (built-in endpoint).](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image220.png 'Select IoT Hub Events Endpoint')

6. Press the **Create** button.

7. This function will be responsible for analyzing instant measurements of engine oil and engine temperature. The threshold for engine oil is to flag any values less than 20, and any engine temperatures greater than 400. Readings that are flagged are to be put into the Service bus **alert-q** that we created earlier in this lab.

8. In order to move flagged messages to the queue, we must declare a Service Bus output for our function. Open the **IoTHub_CriticalAlerts** function that we just created, and select **Integration** from the left menu.

   ![The Function left menu is displayed with the Integration item selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image223.png)

9. Next, select **+ Add output** from the **Outputs** node.

    ![The function Integration diagram is shown with the Add output link highlighted in the Outputs node.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image219.png)

10. In the **Create Output** blade, fill the form as follows:

    a. **Binding Type**: Select the **Azure Service Bus** item.

    b. **Message type**: Select **Service Bus Queue**.

    c. **Message parameter name**: Enter **engineAlertOutput**

    d. **Queue name**: Enter **alert-q**

    ![The Create Output blade is shown and is populated with the preceding values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image224.png 'Define function output')

11. On the same form, select the **New** link beneath the **Service Bus Connection** field. Ensure **Service Bus** is selected, and then select the Service Bus Namespace that you created in [Exercise 2 Task 1: Create Service Bus queue](#task-1-create-service-bus-queue).
  
    ![The New Service Bus connection form is displayed populated with the preceding values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image225.png)

12. Select **OK** to create the Output.

13. From the left menu, select **Code + Test**.

14. This brings up a window with the code for the **index.js** file. Replace the existing content with the following code:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = function (context, IoTHubMessages) {  
        IoTHubMessages.forEach(message => {
            if((message.engineoil && message.engineoil<20) || (message.engineTemperature && message.engineTemperature>400)){
                context.log("Engine Oil: "+ message.engineoil +" - Engine Temperature: "+ message.engineTemperature);
                context.bindings.engineAlertOutput = message;
            }
        });  
        context.done();
    };
    ```

15. Save the code, and watch the Logs for output.

    ![The Azure Function logs are displayed with two engine alerts highlighted in the output](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image228.png 'Function Console Output')

16. After a few minutes, verify the Service Bus queue has messages. Access the queue in the Azure portal, by selecting **All Resources**, and choosing the service bus namespace that was created earlier in this lab, then selecting **Queues** and **alert-q**.

    ![All resources is selected from the main left-hand menu. In the list of resources, the service bus namespace that we created earlier is selected. In the service bus namespace menu, the Queues item is selected. In the list of available queues, the alert-q is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image229.png 'Access the Service Bus Queue')

17. You should see one or more messages ready for processing on the queue.

![Queue Details](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image230.png 'Queue Details')

## Exercise 6: Run a console app to view critical engine alerts from the Service Bus Queue

As you remember, you created an Azure Service Bus Queue to ingest messages flagged as critical engine alerts. This queue is to be fed messages from the IoT Hub that match a certain criteria. In this exercise, you will create the Azure that reads the Service Bus queue one-at-a-time so you can easily view the contents of the alerts.

**Duration:** 10 minutes

### Task 1: Retrieve the Service Bus Queue Connection string

1. Once again, open your **Service Bus** instance in the Azure Portal.

2. Select **Shared access policies** from the left-hand menu.

3. Select the **RootManageSharedAccessKey** policy, then copy the **Primary Connection String** and save it for the next task.

    ![In the Service Bus blade, under Settings, Shared access policies is selected. Under Policy, RootManageSharedAccessKey is selected. The copy button is selected for the Primary Connection String.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image120.png 'Service Bus blade')

### Task 2: Configure and execute the ReadEngineAlerts solution in Visual Studio 2019

1. Browse to the Lab-files folder containing the extracted solution files for the lab.

2. Open **ReadEngineAlerts\\ReadEngineAlerts.sln** with Visual Studio 2019.

3. Open **Program.cs** from the Solution Explorer.

4. Locate the **connectionString** variable and replace {YOUR-CONNECTION-STRING} with the Service Bus connection string that you copied in the previous task.

    ![In Solution Explorer, Program.cs is selected, and the connectionString variable is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image121.png 'Solution Explorer')

5. Right-click the **ReadEngineAlerts** project in Solution Explorer, then select **Start new instance** in the **Debug** submenu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, ReadEngineAlerts is selected, and from its right-click menu, Debug and Start new instance are selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image122.png 'Solution Explorer')

6. You should start to see critical alerts flowing in to the console window.

    ![Critical alerts display with varying colors in the Console window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image123.png 'Console window')

7. Notice that the messages are flagged as anomalous. Meaning that there is a 1 in either the enginetempanomaly, oilanomaly, or aggressivedriving properties. This is due to the filter you defined within the Stream Analytics IoT Edge module.

8. You may close the console when you are finished reviewing the data.

## Exercise 7: Create an Azure Function to ingest critical engine alerts and store them in Cosmos DB

**Duration:** 45 minutes

The console app is a fast and effortless way to view the critical engine alerts flowing through the Service Bus Queue, but it isn't very practical for establishing any business or processing workflow. Azure Functions makes it easy to ingest messages from service Bus, because it provides a Service Bus trigger that executes the function and passes the message object as soon as it is added to the queue. The automated scalability of Azure Functions means that it will add more resources as needed to keep up with demand during peak loads, then scales the resources back down during quieter periods. Azure Functions also provides a Cosmos DB output that makes it very simple to write data to Cosmos DB, which is another massively scalable service. Since other data is already being stored in Cosmos DB, it is a natural choice for these alerts.

## Exercise 10: Process cold data through an event hub

**Duration:** 25 minutes

So far we have seen the near real time analysis of data coming in from our Bus Edge device. Remember only the data being flagged as an alert is immediately being sent to IoT Hub through the Edge Stream Analytics module. The rest of the data is being stored in local storage on the Edge Device. We have configured the local Edge storage to automatically upload its data to the cloud. This module has the intelligence to know if a viable data connection is available before it does its upload, otherwise it will store all data on the device itself - perfect for disconnected scenarios. After data has been uploaded, the Edge Storage module will automatically delete the uploaded data on the device in order to regain storage space. In order to work with this data in Time Series Insights, it needs to be processed through an Event Hub.

### Task 1: Verify cold data is being received in cloud storage

1. In the Azure Portal, open the Storage Account where you created the **telemetrysink** blob container earlier in the lab.

    ![In the storage account, Blobs is selected from the left-hand menu and the telemetrysink container is highlighted in the list of containers.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image249.png 'Blob Storage Containers')

2. Select the **telemetrysink** blob to view its contents. You should see many telemetry files with the extension *.json in the list. Each of these files indicates a reading that has been uploaded by the bus1 Edge device.

    ![Cold Readings From Edge Device are stored in json files that are listed in the telemetrysink blob.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image250.png 'Listing of json files representing readings from the edge device')

### Task 2: Create an event hub to receive the cold data

1. In your resource group, locate and select the Event Hub Namespace that has the same suffix as your IoT hub.

    ![In the list of resources, select the event hub namespace that was created with the Remote Monitoring Accelerator.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image251.png 'The Event Hub Namespace Resource')

2. From the left menu, select **Event Hubs** from the Entities section. Then press the **+ Event Hub** button.

    ![Event Hubs is selected in the left menu, the + Event Hub button is hilighted above the listing of event hubs in the namespace.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image252.png 'Create a new event hub')

3. Name the event hub **colddatahub** and press the **Create** button.

    ![The create event hub form is displayed with the name populated as colddatahub.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image253.png 'Create new event hub form')

### Task 3: Add an input to Stream Analytics to pull the data in from Telemetry storage

1. Open the Stream Analytics job that shares the same suffix as your IoT Hub.

    ![In the list of resources, select the Stream Analytics job that was created from the Remote Monitoring Accelerator.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image254.png 'Stream Analytics Resource')  

2. Stop the Stream Analytics job by pressing the **Stop** button on the top of the **Overview** window.

    ![The Stream Analytics overview screen is displayed. The Stop button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image255.png 'Stop the Stream Analytics Job')

3. Once stopped, select **Inputs** from the **Job Topology** section, then press the **+ Add stream input** button.

    ![From the left-hand menu, the Inputs item is selected. In the inputs window the Add stream input button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image256.png 'Add stream input menu')

4. Select to add **Blob storage** input.

    ![The Add Stream input menu is shown with the blob storage item selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image257.png 'Add blob storage input')

5. Create the input as follows:

   a. **Input Alias**: ColdStorage

   b. Select the **Select Blob storage from your subscriptions** option.
  
   c. **Storage Account**: select the storage account that shares the same suffix as your IoT Hub.
  
   d. **Container**, select to **Use existing** and choose the **telemetrysink** container.
  
   e. Press **Save**.

### Task 4: Add an output to Stream Analytics to forward data to an Event Hub  

1. Next, from the left hand menu select **Outputs**, then select to add an **Event Hub** output.

    ![Outputs is selected from the left hand menu, and the Add button is selcted with the Event Hub item chosen from the sub menu](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image258.png 'Add stream analytics output')

2. Create the output as follows:

    a. **Output Alias**: ColdDataHub

    b. Choose the **Select Event Hub from your subscription** item.
  
    c. **Subscription**: Select the appropriate subscription.
  
    d. **Event Hub Namespace**: Select the event hub namespace that shares the same suffix as your IoT Hub.
  
    e. **Event Hub name**: Select **Use existing**, then select **colddatahub**.
  
    f. Press **Save**.

    ![The Event Output Form is displayed populated with the previous values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image259.png 'Event Output Form')

### Task 5: Modify the Stream Analytics Query to send data from storage to the event hub

1. From the left menu, select **Query**.

2. We will first define our input dataset to pull data from storage. To do this, immediately following the **WITH** keyword, insert the following:

    ```sql
    ColdData As
    (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM ColdStorage TIMESTAMP BY [timestamp]
    ),
    ```

    ![The query editor is displayed showing the cold data query directly beneath the WITH keyword.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image260.png 'Add the input query')

3. Next, we will direct all data being read from storage and send it to our Event Hub output that we defined. To do this, scroll to the end of the query and append the following:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    INTO ColdDataHub
    FROM ColdData
    ```

    ![The query window is displayed with the above code appended to it](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image261.png 'Add the output query')

4. Save the query.

5. From the left menu, select **Overview**, then press the **Start** button to restart the stream job.

    ![The Stream Analytics Job overview screen is displayed with the Start button selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image262.png)

## Exercise 11: View all data in Azure Time Series Insights

**Duration:** 15 minutes

Now that the critical engine alert data is being recorded, and we have folded in the telemetry coming in from storage to an event hub as well, we can view this data in Time Series Insights.

   f. **Event Hub name**: Select **colddatahub**.

   g. **Timestamp property name**: Enter **timestamp**

   h. Press **Create**.

> **Note**: The timestamp property is part of the telemetry data, this tells Time Series Insights how to ensure the data is arranged in the appropriate date/time order.

### Task 3: Go to the Time Series Insights environment and use the data explorer

1. Select **Overview** from the left-hand menu, then select **Go to Environment**.

    ![In the Data Access Policies blade, the Go to Environment button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image155.png 'Data Access Policies blade')

2. The Time Series Insights data explorer will open in a new tab. By default, a chart displaying a count of all events is displayed. Notice how there is a timeline directly underneath the chart, and a more macro-level timeline below that, showing a span of several hours.

    ![A chart displays for 1 series of 1 total in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image156.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

3. Use the **Terms Editor Panel** located on the left-hand side of the screen to query your environment. Select **Add**.

    ![Add is selected in the Terms Editor Panel.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image157.png 'Terms Editor Panel')

4. The Measure drop down shows all numeric columns (Doubles), and the Split By drop down shows categorical columns (Strings). To compare voltages for the traffic lights, select **voltage** under Measure, then **serial_number** under Split By.

    ![The Measure and Split by fields are called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image158.png 'Measure and Split by fields')

5. You will now see the two traffic lights listed by serial number, on the same chart as the total event count. You can hover over a serial number to the left of the chart to highlight its place on the chart.

    ![This time, 3 series of 3 total display in chart format in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image159.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

6. Select the **gear** within the new measure you created, then place a check in the box next to **Use Step Interpolation** and **Show Min/Max**.

    ![The Gear icon is selected and its menu displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image160.png 'Gear icon')

7. The chart will update to reflect those changes. Notice how Show Min/Max creates a shadow behind the interpolated line to show the minimum and maximum voltage values. This is because the displayed line is the average voltage value.

    ![The described multi-dimensional chart displays in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image161.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

8. Right-click on a line on the chart and select **Explore Events**.

    ![The right-click menu displays with Explore Events selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image162.png 'Right-click menu')

9. You will see all the raw event data for the events displayed within the visible time range for the selected terms. You may select which columns you want to view and export the data if desired.

    ![The Events tab displays. Select all columns is selected, and raw data displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image163.png 'Events tab')

### Task 3: View the simulated and IoT Edge bus data side-by-side

Because all telemetry data that flows through IoT Hub is captured in Time Series Insights, it is possible to view this information in one place, creating a data context that's based on time of occurrence and any additional data points you need. In this case, we will overlay the simulated bus GPS device data from the IoT Remote Monitoring simulator, with the vehicle telemetry data generated and filtered by the bus IoT Edge device.

1. Delete the traffic light voltage query and add a new query set in the Terms Editor Panel. Select **averageenginetemperature** as the Measure, and Split By **none**. Update the Where clause with the following: vin = \'Y3J9PV9TN36A4DUB9\'.

    ![The New Query section displays with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image164.png 'New Query section')

2. Add a new query set. Select **speed** as the measure, and **Split By** iothub-connection-device-id. Update the Where clause with the following: vin = \'Y3J9PV9TN36A4DUB9\' AND \[iothub-connection-module-id\] = NULL.

    ![The New Query section displays with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image165.png 'New Query section')

3. The where clause ensures that the simulated bus GPS device data matches up with the bus IoT Edge device by setting the VIN for both to the same value. Since both event sources contain a "speed" field, we want to rely on the reported speed from the GPS device, as it is updated more regularly. To do this, the where clause returns only those items whose "iothub-connection-module-id" is null. Only IoT Edge devices will contain an Id in this field.

4. The chart shows both the average engine temperature and the reported bus speed from the GPS device stacked one on top of the other.

    ![This time, 3 series of 3 total graphs display in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image166.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

5. To overlay the data, hide the overall event Count in the Terms Editor Panel, use step interpolation on the IoT Edge and simulated bus queries to make it easier to see the overlaid values, then deselect the stack terms option on the chart. This view may make it easier to spot correlations between different data sets, such as this one.

    ![2 series of 2 total graphs display in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer chart, and the overlay icon is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image167.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

### Task 4: Use Perspective View to create a simultaneous view of up to four unique queries

1. Select the Perspective View icon on the upper-right corner of the chart.

    ![Screenshot of the perspective view icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image168.png 'Perspective view icon')

2. Select the **Clone query** button in the empty panel to the right of the chart. This will create a new chart using the same query, making it faster to add related data.

    ![The Clone query icon is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image169.png 'Clone query icon')

3. Select the cloned chart to modify it.

    ![Two charts display (the original and the cloned) in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image170.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

4. Remove the speed terms, then modify the IoT Edge device terms (those based on the average engine temperature) by selecting **transmission_gear_position** under Split By. This should now be the only visible term.

    ![The Edge device terms fields display with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image171.png 'Edge device terms fields')

5. Select **Heatmap** for the chart type. It is easy to quickly spot anomalies in this view, where there are random hot and cold spots. This data is split by the transmission gear position so you can try and correlate engine temperatures with transmission gears.

    ![A heatmap displays in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image172.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

6. Go back to the Perspective View to see these two charts side-by-side.

    ![In the Time Series Insights Data Explorer Perspective view, a chart displays on the left, and a heat map displays on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image173.png 'Perspective View')

7. Select the **Save** icon to share the Perspective, give it a name, and save it.

    ![The Save icon is selected, and from its drop-down menu, the new graph is named Engine temp perspective, and is set to Share this Perspective.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image174.png 'Save icon')

8. Now any users who have access to the Time Series Insights environment can view your saved Perspective.
